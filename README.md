A mini-site housing [reading] decoding strategies; an interactive tool for primary learners and their families. // Live site in active use with my classroom community // JS audio complete!

This project gave me an opportunity to put my goals of (educational) transparency and accessibility into practice. I work with students/families from a variety of backgrounds/abilities and I wanted to give them keys to basic (English) literacy success. The audio and visual details were added to achieve those ends, as were links to additional resources. Future goals include keyboard accessibility and refactoring.
